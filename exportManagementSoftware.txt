use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Source {
    id: String,
    name: String,
    location: Location,
    products: Vec<ProductOffering>,
    performance: PerformanceMetrics,
}
```

**API Layer:**
```rust
// RESTful API with Axum
use axum::{
    routing::{get, post, put, delete},
    Router, Json,
};

async fn create_order(Json(order): Json<CreateOrderRequest>) -> Json<OrderResponse> {
    // Order creation logic
}
```

### Frontend Architecture (React + Tauri)

**Component Structure:**
```jsx
// Main application components
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Sidebar />
      <MainContent>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
          <Route path="/sources" component={SourceManager} />
          <Route path="/products" component={ProductCatalog} />
          <Route path="/orders" component={OrderManager} />
          <Route path="/shipping" component={ShippingTracker} />
          <Route path="/documents" component={DocumentCenter} />
        </Routes>
      </MainContent>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

**State Management:**
```jsx
// Using React Context for global state
const AppContext = createContext();

const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [sources, setSources] = useState([]);
  const [orders, setOrders] = useState([]);
  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);
  
  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ sources, orders, notifications }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Local AI Integration

**Ollama Integration:**
```rust
// Local LLM integration for business intelligence
use ollama_rs::{Ollama, generation::completion::request::GenerationRequest};

async fn get_business_advice(query: &str) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let ollama = Ollama::default();
    let model = "llama2:7b".to_string();
    
    let request = GenerationRequest::new(model, query.to_string());
    let response = ollama.generate(request).await?;
    
    Ok(response.response)
}
```

**Candle ML Integration:**
```rust
// Local ML models for predictions and analysis
use candle_core::{Device, Tensor};
use candle_nn::{Linear, Module};

struct PricePredictionModel {
    linear: Linear,
}

impl PricePredictionModel {
    fn predict(&self, features: &Tensor) -> candle_core::Result<Tensor> {
        self.linear.forward(features)
    }
}
```

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vendors component in the admin panel is experiencing a TypeError where it cannot read the 'length' property of undefined. This occurs when the component tries to access array properties before the data has been properly initialized or when API calls fail. The system needs robust error handling and proper state initialization to prevent crashes and provide a better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the vendor management page to load without crashing, so that I can access vendor information even when there are data loading issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vendors page loads THEN the system SHALL initialize all array states with empty arrays instead of undefined
2. WHEN API calls fail or return undefined data THEN the system SHALL handle these cases gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN accessing array properties like length THEN the system SHALL ensure the array exists before accessing its properties
4. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL display appropriate loading states or empty states instead of crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see meaningful error messages when vendor data fails to load, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vendor data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN API requests timeout or fail THEN the system SHALL show specific error information
3. WHEN there are network connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
4. WHEN the error state is active THEN the system SHALL prevent further actions that depend on the missing data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the vendor management interface to be resilient to data inconsistencies, so that I can continue working even when some data is missing or malformed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vendor objects have missing properties THEN the system SHALL provide default values or handle the missing data gracefully
2. WHEN pagination data is undefined THEN the system SHALL use default pagination values
3. WHEN stats data is missing THEN the system SHALL display zeros or placeholder values instead of crashing
4. WHEN filters are applied to undefined data THEN the system SHALL handle the filtering operations safely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error boundaries and defensive programming practices in the vendor component, so that the application remains stable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any part of the vendor component encounters an error THEN the system SHALL contain the error and prevent it from crashing the entire application
2. WHEN state updates occur THEN the system SHALL validate the data before setting state
3. WHEN rendering lists or tables THEN the system SHALL check for data existence before mapping or iterating
4. WHEN performing operations on arrays THEN the system SHALL use safe array methods that handle undefined/null values

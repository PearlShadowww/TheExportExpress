# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the core foundation and data architecture for ExportMaster Pro, a desktop application built with Tauri and Rust designed to manage the complete export lifecycle for Indian exporters. This phase establishes the fundamental technology stack, database architecture, and basic user interface framework that will support all subsequent features including source management, product catalogs, order processing, and logistics tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an export business owner, I want a robust desktop application foundation, so that I can reliably manage my export operations without depending on internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load within 5 seconds on standard hardware
2. WHEN the user operates offline THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality with local data
3. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. IF the system crashes THEN the application SHALL automatically recover user data and resume from the last saved state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an export manager, I want a comprehensive database system for suppliers, products, and trade regulations, so that I can make informed sourcing and compliance decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing supplier information THEN the system SHALL capture contact details, performance metrics, product offerings, and relationship history
2. WHEN managing product data THEN the system SHALL store specifications, market data, regulatory requirements, and logistics information
3. WHEN accessing trade regulations THEN the system SHALL provide current export/import rules, documentation requirements, and compliance procedures
4. IF data integrity issues occur THEN the system SHALL validate data consistency and prevent corruption
5. WHEN querying large datasets THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds using proper indexing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive navigation system with multiple modules, so that I can efficiently access different aspects of my export business.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the application THEN the system SHALL provide clear menu structure for all major modules
2. WHEN switching between modules THEN the system SHALL preserve user context and unsaved changes
3. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support common navigation and action shortcuts
4. IF the user prefers different themes THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark mode interfaces
5. WHEN accessing help information THEN the system SHALL provide contextual guidance for each module

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an export business owner, I want secure local data storage with backup capabilities, so that my business-critical information is protected and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all business information using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN creating backups THEN the system SHALL automatically backup data daily with user-configurable schedules
3. WHEN synchronizing data THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully and preserve data integrity
4. IF data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL restore from the most recent valid backup automatically
5. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL implement role-based permissions for different user types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured API layer and service architecture, so that the system can be easily extended with additional features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL separate concerns using distinct service layers
2. WHEN exposing functionality THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints with proper error handling
3. WHEN handling data operations THEN the system SHALL implement proper validation and sanitization
4. IF external integrations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide extensible interfaces for third-party services
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support seamless updates without data loss

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an export manager, I want the system to support multiple languages and regional preferences, so that I can work in my preferred language and accommodate international clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting language preferences THEN the system SHALL support English and Hindi interfaces
2. WHEN displaying currency values THEN the system SHALL format amounts according to regional conventions
3. WHEN showing dates and times THEN the system SHALL use locale-appropriate formatting
4. IF new languages are needed THEN the system SHALL provide an extensible localization framework
5. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL update the interface without requiring restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN the application SHALL log all significant operations with timestamps
2. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track response times, memory usage, and database query performance
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert users and suggest optimization actions
5. WHEN analyzing usage patterns THEN the system SHALL provide anonymized usage statistics for improvement

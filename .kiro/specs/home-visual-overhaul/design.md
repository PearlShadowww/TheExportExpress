  scale: 1.05,
  z: 50,
  transition: {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 300,
    damping: 20
  }
};

// Staggered entrance animation

  visible: (i: number) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    scale: 1,
    transition: {
      delay: i * 0.2,
      duration: 0.8,
      ease: "easeOut"
    }
  })
};
```

### 3. Interactive Statistics Section

**Visual Design:**
- Counting animation for numbers with easing functions
- Glassmorphism cards with dynamic backgrounds
- Progress bars with animated fills
- Hover effects with color transitions
- Background pattern animations

**Animation Specifications:**
```typescript
// Number counting animation
const useCountAnimation = (end: number, duration: number = 2000) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    const animate = () => {
      const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
      const progress = Math.min(elapsed / duration, 1);
      const easeOutQuart = 1 - Math.pow(1 - progress, 4);
      setCount(Math.floor(end * easeOutQuart));
      
      if (progress < 1) requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
    animate();
  }, [end, duration]);
  
  return count;
};
```

### 4. Enhanced Typography System

**Font Hierarchy:**
- H1: 4rem desktop, 2.5rem mobile with gradient text effect
- H2: 3rem desktop, 2rem mobile with subtle shadow
- H3: 2rem desktop, 1.5rem mobile with accent colors
- Body: 1.125rem with optimized line height (1.7)
- Caption: 0.875rem with increased letter spacing

**Text Animation Effects:**
```css
.gradient-text {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #5C3D2E 0%, #8B6F47 50%, #6B4E71 100%);
  background-size: 200% 200%;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  animation: gradientShift 4s ease-in-out infinite;
}

.text-reveal {
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
}

.text-reveal::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: var(--color-primary);
  animation: textReveal 1.5s ease-out forwards;
}
```

### 5. Scroll-Based Animations

**Parallax System:**
- Background elements move at different speeds (0.5x, 0.8x, 1.2x)
- Foreground content maintains normal scroll speed
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Performance-optimized with transform3d

**Viewport Animations:**
- Fade-in effects with staggered timing
- Slide-up animations with spring physics
- Scale animations for emphasis
- Rotation effects for decorative elements

## Data Models

### Animation Configuration
```typescript
interface AnimationConfig {
  duration: number;
  delay: number;
  easing: string;
  repeat?: boolean | number;
  direction?: 'normal' | 'reverse' | 'alternate';
}

interface ParallaxConfig {
  speed: number;
  direction: 'vertical' | 'horizontal';
  element: HTMLElement;
}

interface TypewriterConfig {
  text: string;
  speed: number;
  deleteSpeed?: number;
  pauseDuration?: number;
  loop?: boolean;
}
```

### Visual Effects State
```typescript
interface VisualEffectsState {
  isHeroVisible: boolean;
  scrollProgress: number;
  mousePosition: { x: number; y: number };
  reducedMotion: boolean;
  deviceType: 'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop';
}
```

## Error Handling

### Animation Fallbacks
- Detect `prefers-reduced-motion` and provide static alternatives
- Graceful degradation for older browsers without CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Performance monitoring to disable heavy animations on low-end devices
- Fallback fonts for custom typography

### Performance Optimization
```typescript
// Intersection Observer for performance
const useIntersectionObserver = (threshold = 0.1) => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const ref = useRef<HTMLElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => setIsVisible(entry.isIntersecting),
      { threshold }
    );

    if (ref.current) observer.observe(ref.current);
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [threshold]);

  return [ref, isVisible] as const;
};
```

### Error Boundaries
- Wrap animation components in error boundaries
- Provide fallback UI for animation failures
- Log animation performance metrics
- Graceful handling of missing assets

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparisons for different viewport sizes

- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking for animations

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility with animations
- Keyboard navigation through interactive elements
- Color contrast validation for gradient text
- Motion sensitivity compliance testing

### Performance Testing
```typescript
// Animation performance monitoring
const useAnimationPerformance = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    let frameCount = 0;
    let lastTime = performance.now();

    const measureFPS = () => {
      frameCount++;
      const currentTime = performance.now();
      
      if (currentTime - lastTime >= 1000) {
        const fps = frameCount;
        console.log(`Animation FPS: ${fps}`);
        
        if (fps < 30) {
          // Reduce animation complexity
          document.body.classList.add('reduced-animations');
        }
        
        frameCount = 0;
        lastTime = currentTime;
      }
      
      requestAnimationFrame(measureFPS);
    };
    
    measureFPS();
  }, []);
};
```
